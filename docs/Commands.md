2) Write text bot will say after command was told in chat.
For now bot can't do stuff like kick, give auto-role or etc...
But it is planed to add this features to custom commands.
```The advanced command plugin is a soon-to-be-released MAGIC plugin!
It will let you add some advanced commands with arguments like !your_command @someone @someoneelse
You'll also be able to trigger some actions like send_message, send_private_message, kick, add_role etc...
AND one more thing... You'll be able to share your commands in a Public Command Hub so that other server managers can use them.```

3) Now you need to press `Add` button to save command and add it to server.
To use command in chat type `!command_name` and bot will respond.
