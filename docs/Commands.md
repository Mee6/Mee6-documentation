###To Add a Custom Command Follow These Steps:
  
**1**) Write the name you wish the command to have.  
In the command name, you can only have: `letters, numbers, - or _`  
Also, you do not need to write `!` at the start, it's added automatically.  
  
**2**) Write the return text you wish for the bot to say.  
At the current time, the bot cannot do special function; Only return messages.  
However, this is planned to be added as a feature to advanced commands that will come in the future.  

> The advanced command plugin is a *not-so-soon-to-be-released* MAGIC plugin!
> It will let you add some advanced commands with arguments like !your_command @someone @someoneelse
> You'll also be able to trigger some actions like send_message, send_private_message, kick, add_role etc...
> AND one more thing... You'll be able to share your commands in a **Public Command Hub** so that other server managers can use them.

**3**) Now you press the `Add` button to save your command and add it to your Discord Server.  
To use the command in chat, simple type `!command_name` and the bot will send the response.
